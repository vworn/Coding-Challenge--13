Coding Challenge: Employee Management System Dashboard
Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you'll create an interactive dashboard for managing employees in a company. You will leverage your skills in DOM manipulation to dynamically add, update, and remove employee cards. This challenge will reinforce your understanding of selecting nodes, using methods like createElement, appendChild, removeChild, and handling event propagation (with stopPropagation()). The business case simulates real-world scenarios where a company manages employee data interactively.
